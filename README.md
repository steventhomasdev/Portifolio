# Portifolio

Meta front end engineer

Your header should contain the client logo and the main content should be a large promotional banner with three columns with text and images below it

Your footer will have two columns: the first column should have a small logo and the second one should have copywriting information

When it comes to styling, you'll have to create the appropriate look and feel for your client's target audience. Remember, you want to create intentional engagement!
